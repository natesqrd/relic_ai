    This will be the main program running using the Discord Bot API
    to implement Relic_AI. Relic_AI is a "homework helper" AI.
    Eventually the AI will be developed into a full chat system like
    Siri or Alexa to answer questions on educational subjects from an academic database.

    The purpose of the academic database is to maintain accuracy of content rather than
    attempting to check the validity of content pulled from the internet
